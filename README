This is an IRC logging bot, and a CGI web interface for showing the logs.

The documentation can be found at http://moritz.faui2k3.org/en/ilbot

Installation instructs are still sorely missing, sorry about that.

Note that in production mode, pages are cached for performance reason.
During the installation, you should have caching disabled (by
setting NO_CACHE = 1 in www.conf). Once you're confident with your setup,
remove that setting again.

WARNING: When upgrading from previous versions of ilbot, and if you haven't
done it yet, you might need to change the SQL schema by running the
update-sql-add-summary.sql SQL file against your database, like

    mysql yourdatabse < update-sql-add-summary.sql

This might take a while, depending on the size of your database. During that
time, the IRC logs won't work properly.
